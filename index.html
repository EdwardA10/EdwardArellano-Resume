        <div class="subheading mb-5">Computer Engineering üìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Edward Arellano, a 5th year undergraduate student of UC Riverside. I am a computer engineering major and am due to graduate in March 2023.<br><br>

        I grew up in Palm Springs, California my entire life before moving to Riverside to begin my undergraduate career. Growing up I loved playing video games and playing soccer, my two favorite pastimes by far. 
        While attending Palm Springs High School, I gained a passion for filmmaking, running, editing, and screenwriting. I formed a team that won ‚ÄúMost Liked Film‚Äù at Digicom Film Festival, a film competition between the 
        majority of schools located in the Coachella Valley. During my time working on films in high school and playing video games, I found myself curious as to how the programs and software I used all connected to each other
        to do work and to create an enjoyable experience for the user. It was through this curiosity that I tried my first hand at programming through Python. I wasn‚Äôt very skilled at this, as there were no computer science 
        programs or classes at my school and I conducted much of my learning through YouTube videos. I was barely able to create simple input/output text-based programs but it was because of this that I knew I wanted to pursue 
        computer engineering when I would attend college. After college acceptances season, a visit to UC Riverside made me fall in love with the school and I quickly submitted my intent to register as a student.<br><br>

        In my time at UCR, I‚Äôve gained work experience beyond the purview of my academic field. I was hired by UCR Residential Life during my fourth year as a program advisor for a Living Learning Community (LLC). As a program 
        advisor, I would plan and conduct programs and events in order to facilitate the success and growth of first year residents attending UCR. My focus was in experiential and cultural LLC‚Äôs, meaning that I served and represented
        the many underrepresented cultural communities at UCR. I would work with my team to plan the distribution of funds for projects, to determine who would serve which roles for an event, and to ensure that particular learning 
        objectives and goals were met during a program. My time in UCR Residential Life helped me grow as a professional and helped me understand how work is done in a professional setting. <br><br>
        
        Academically, I‚Äôve gained much more experience with programming. I‚Äôve attained a greater insight into the workings of data structures and algorithms; alongside this knowledge, my experience with C and C++ improved tremendously,
        with C++ becoming my primary programming language. Additionally, I have taken courses in which I learned basic fundamental syntax for languages such as Verilog, Python, HTML, and CSS. I‚Äôve taken courses that have greatly 
        improved my understanding of computing aspects that stem beyond the scope of traditional programming and algorithms such as: operating systems, assembly language, artificial intelligence, discrete mathematics and structures,
        software construction & system design patterns, and embedded systems. As a computer engineering major, I‚Äôve had to dwell into the realm of electrical engineering, obtaining wisdom on electrical systems and electronic circuits.
        I don‚Äôt have much experience with projects outside of those I have created within the classroom, but these projects all utilized key concepts within the world of programming and engineering.
